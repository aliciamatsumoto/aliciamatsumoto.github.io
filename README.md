This is a quick portfolio intended to highlight projects 
with a little more detail than my resume can provide. I hope that one day it can also
be a blog or a place where I store my photos and 
important memories.

Some outdated versions of my resume list that 
I made this website from scratch as a personal project. That is no longer the case (I updated it via a template to make it easier to make changes). An archive of the website I designed can be found <a href="https://github.com/aliciamatsumoto/codysite-sp20">here</a>.
